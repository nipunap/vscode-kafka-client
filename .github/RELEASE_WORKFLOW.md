## Architecture

### Job Structure

The workflow is split into **7 independent jobs** for better isolation and parallel execution:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[wait-for-ci] --> B[version-check]
    B --> C[security]
    B --> D[build]
    C --> D
    D --> E[release]
    E --> F[publish-vscode]
    E --> G[publish-openvsx]
    F --> H[rollback]
    G --> H
    E --> I[summary]
    F --> I
    G --> I
```

### Job Responsibilities

| Job | Purpose | Timeout | Can Fail? |
|-----|---------|---------|-----------|
| `wait-for-ci` | Ensures CI passes before proceeding | 30m | ❌ No |
| `version-check` | Validates version bump and checks tags | 5m | ❌ No |
| `security` | Security scan + dependency review | 15m | ❌ No |
| `build` | Compile, package, validate VSIX | 15m | ❌ No |
| `release` | Create GitHub Release | 10m | ❌ No |
| `publish-vscode` | Publish to VS Code Marketplace | 15m | ✅ Yes |
| `publish-openvsx` | Publish to Open VSX Registry | 15m | ✅ Yes |
| `rollback` | Handle catastrophic failures | 5m | ✅ Yes |
| `summary` | Generate comprehensive summary | 2m | ✅ Yes |

---

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed `wait-for-ci` Race Condition

**Problem:** Workflow could wait for checks from previous commit, not current one.

**Solution:**
```yaml
- name: Wait for CI checks
  uses: lewagon/wait-on-check-action@v1.3.4
  with:
    ref: ${{ github.sha }}
    running-workflow-name: 'Wait for CI'  # ← Added this
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed `ls *.vsix` Robustness

**Problem:** Glob expansion fails if no files found, doesn't handle multiple files.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Robust method with error handling
VSIX_FILE=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.vsix" -type f | head -n 1)

if [ -z "$VSIX_FILE" ]; then
  echo "❌ No VSIX file found"
  exit 1
fi

# Warn about multiple files
VSIX_COUNT=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.vsix" -type f | wc -l)
if [ "$VSIX_COUNT" -gt 1 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Multiple VSIX files found, using: $VSIX_FILE"
fi
```

### 3. ✅ Handle `github.event.before` Edge Cases

**Problem:** Can be `0000...` on first commit or after force push.

**Solution:**
```yaml
base-ref: ${{ 
  github.event.before != '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' 
  && github.event.before 
  || format('refs/tags/v{0}', needs.version-check.outputs.previous_version) 
}}
```

### 4. ✅ Upgraded super-linter v4 → v7

**Changes:**
- Latest security vulnerability fixes
- Support for newer Node.js/TypeScript features
- Better performance
- Updated linter rules

### 5. ✅ Use Git Tags for Version Comparison

**Problem:** `HEAD~1` comparison can miss version changes if multiple commits modified `package.json`.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Get last released version from git tags
LAST_TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match "v*.*.*" 2>/dev/null || echo "v0.0.0")
PREVIOUS_VERSION=${LAST_TAG#v}

# Also check if version already tagged (prevent double-release)
if git rev-parse "v$CURRENT_VERSION" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "Version already tagged, skipping release"
  exit 0
fi
```

### 6. ✅ Added Rollback Mechanism

**Triggers on:** Both VS Code and Open VSX publishes fail (catastrophic failure)

**Action:** Creates a GitHub issue for manual decision (does not auto-rollback)

**Options provided:**
- Retry publishing manually (recommended)
- Rollback release and tag
- Keep as pre-release

---

## New Features

### 1. 🎁 VSIX Artifact Upload

```yaml
- name: Upload VSIX artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: vscode-kafka-${{ needs.version-check.outputs.version }}.vsix
    path: '*.vsix'
    retention-days: 90
```

**Benefits:**
- Download VSIX without rebuilding
- Manual publishing if automation fails
- Audit trail for releases

### 2. 🔍 Comprehensive VSIX Validation

Validates:
- ✅ File exists and has reasonable size (1KB - 100MB)
- ✅ Contains required files (`extension/package.json`, `extension.vsixmanifest`)
- ✅ Version in VSIX matches expected version
- ✅ Structure is valid (can be unzipped)
- ✅ Warns if file is unusually large (> 50MB)

### 3. ⏱️ Timeouts on Everything

Every job and critical step has timeouts to prevent hanging:
- Jobs: 2m - 30m depending on complexity
- Steps: 2m - 10m for long-running operations

### 4. 📊 Comprehensive Summary

GitHub Step Summary shows:
- Previous and new version
- Status of all pipeline stages
- Links to release and artifacts
- Overall status indicator

### 5. 🔒 Better Security

- Minimal permissions (principle of least privilege)
- Added `security-events: write` for dependency-review
- Security scans run BEFORE release creation
- No secrets in logs

---

## Workflow Behavior

### Happy Path

```
1. Push to main with package.json change
2. Wait for CI to pass (30m max)
3. Check version changed (compare with git tags)
4. Run security scan + dependency review
5. Build and package extension
6. Validate VSIX thoroughly
7. Upload VSIX as artifact
8. Create GitHub Release
9. Publish to VS Code Marketplace (parallel)
10. Publish to Open VSX Registry (parallel)
11. Generate summary
```

### Failure Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Security Scan Fails
- ❌ Stops before creating release
- ❌ No tag created
- ❌ No marketplace publish
- ✅ Workflow fails with clear error

#### Scenario B: Build Fails
- ❌ Stops before creating release
- ❌ No tag created
- ✅ Workflow fails with clear error

#### Scenario C: One Marketplace Fails
- ✅ GitHub Release created
- ✅ Tag created
- ✅ One marketplace published successfully
- ⚠️ Issue created for failed marketplace
- ✅ Workflow succeeds (partial success)

#### Scenario D: Both Marketplaces Fail
- ✅ GitHub Release created
- ✅ Tag created
- ❌ No marketplace published
- 🚨 Critical issue created
- ⚠️ Workflow completes but with warning

#### Scenario E: Version Already Tagged
- ℹ️ Skips release (idempotent)
- ✅ Workflow succeeds with no-op

## Required Secrets

### VS Code Marketplace (Optional)

```
Secret: AZURE_TOKEN
How to get:
1. Go to https://dev.azure.com
2. User Settings → Personal Access Tokens
3. Create token with "Marketplace (Manage)" scope
4. Add to repository secrets as AZURE_TOKEN
```

### Open VSX Registry (Optional)

```
Secret: OPEN_VSX_ACCESS_TOKEN
How to get:
1. Go to https://open-vsx.org
2. Sign in and go to User Settings
3. Create new Access Token
4. Add to repository secrets as OPEN_VSX_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

**Note:** If secrets are not configured, those marketplace publishes are gracefully skipped.

---

## Testing the Workflow

### Manual Testing

```bash
# 1. Create a test branch
git checkout -b test-release

# 2. Bump version
npm version patch  # or minor, major

# 3. Push to trigger workflow
git push origin test-release

# 4. Create PR and merge to main
```

### Dry Run (No Publishing)

Remove both secrets temporarily to test everything except actual publishing:
- Remove `AZURE_TOKEN` secret
- Remove `OPEN_VSX_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret

The workflow will:
- ✅ Run all validations
- ✅ Create GitHub Release
- ⏭️ Skip marketplace publishes

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

## Maintenance

### When to Update

- **Quarterly:** Check for action version updates
- **Annually:** Review and update Node.js version
- **As needed:** Adjust timeouts based on actual durations

### Key Actions to Watch

```yaml
- actions/checkout@v4           # Stable
- actions/setup-node@v4         # Stable
- actions/upload-artifact@v4    # Stable
- github/super-linter@v7        # Check quarterly
- actions/dependency-review-action@v4  # Check quarterly
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workflow doesn't trigger

**Check:**
1. `package.json` was changed in the commit
2. Commit was pushed to `main` branch
3. Workflow file has no syntax errors

### Issue: "Version unchanged"

**Check:**
1. Version in `package.json` different from last git tag
2. Version follows semver format (X.Y.Z)
3. Version is greater than previous version
4. Version not already tagged

### Issue: Security scan fails

**Check:**
1. No linting errors in code
2. YAML/JSON files are valid
3. Check super-linter logs for specific errors

### Issue: VSIX validation fails

**Check:**
1. `npm run package` completes successfully locally
2. VSIX file is created
3. VSIX structure is correct (unzip and inspect)

### Issue: Marketplace publish fails

**Check:**
1. Secret is configured correctly
2. Secret hasn't expired (Azure PAT)
3. Publisher ID matches in package.json
4. Extension name is unique
5. Network/marketplace status

---

## Security Considerations

### Permissions Used

```yaml
permissions:
  actions: read          # For wait-on-check
  checks: read           # For wait-on-check
  contents: write        # For creating releases
  issues: write          # For creating failure issues
  security-events: write # For dependency-review
  pull-requests: read    # For CI checks
```

### Secrets Handling

- ✅ Never logged
- ✅ Only used in specific steps
- ✅ Continue-on-error prevents exposure
- ✅ No secrets in artifact files

### Dependencies

All GitHub Actions are pinned to major versions (@v4, @v7) for:
- ✅ Automatic security updates
- ✅ Stability (no breaking changes)
- ❌ No SHA pinning (makes updates easier)

---

## Future Improvements

### Potential Additions

1. **Smoke Tests:** Install published extension and run basic tests
2. **Changelog Validation:** Ensure changelog has entry for version
3. **Screenshot Updates:** Automated screenshot capture
4. **Marketplace Analytics:** Post-publish metrics
5. **Slack/Discord Notifications:** Real-time alerts
6. **Canary Releases:** Publish to test marketplace first
7. **Release Notes AI:** Generate release notes from commits

### Not Recommended

- ❌ Auto-rollback: Too risky, prefer manual decision
- ❌ Auto-version bump: Should be explicit in PR
- ❌ Skip security scans: Never compromise on security
